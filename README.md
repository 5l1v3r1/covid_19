# SARS-CoV-2 Cases communicated by Swiss Cantons and Principality of Liechtenstein (FL)

We are providing a common official OGD dataset of SARS-CoV-2 case numbers, which are communicated by official Swiss canton's (26 cantons, abbreviations see below) and Principality of Liechtenstein's (abbreviation: FL) sources.

The infection rates refer to the infection with
[SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2),
whereas the disease caused by the virus is called [Covid-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019).

We are providing SARS-CoV-2 case numbers *in machine-readable form (CSV)* as OGD resources (Open Government Data), that *have been published  by official sources (Cantons and FL) online*. Sources are specified with the respective URL(s).

Case numbers include persons tested and treated in the respective Canton resp. Principality of Liechtenstein. *Important:* Since 09.03.2020, only persons who meet certain test criteria are tested (see e.g. with the Canton of Zurich "Testkriterien" at www.gd.zh.ch/coronavirus).

The data is updated regularly - if available daily. Times of collection and update of the data may vary. We are specifying the date of the last reporting, and - if available - a time-stamp, too.

The data is both automatically and manually updated, and regularly checked. We are performing three times a day complete manual updates and verifications; these "roundtrips" are starting at 8am, 2pm and 8pm. They are usally completed within 60 minutes.

There is a [merged file](https://github.com/openZH/covid_19/blob/master/COVID19_Fallzahlen_CH_total.csv) of all Cantons and FL that is automatically updated for use in data analysis.

You can get started exploring the data with `visualise.ipynb` ([run it in your browser](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/openZH/covid_19/master?filepath=visualise.ipynb)).

We are available to advise and support interested authorities, how to easily complete both historized data, and missing columns. You can reach us:

# Data structure
The data of the Cantonal case numbers is structured as follows:

The Data for [Genev√©](https://github.com/openZH/covid_19/blob/master/fallzahlen_kanton_total_csv/COVID19_Fallzahlen_Kanton_GE_total.csv) contains an additional column reporting the number of currently intubated patients. This column will be integrated into all files shortly.
| Field Name          | Description                                | Format     |
