## Other Cantons and the Confederation

We invite other Cantons and the Confederation to provide case numbers in the same structure, regularly updated and machine-readable as Open Government Data (OGD).

The data is structured in such a way, it can be easily expanded both horizontally (Cantons) and vertically (Confederation).

The aim is to create a common official OGD dataset of the Swiss Authorities.

We are available to advise and support interested authorities. You can reach us during office hours at: info@open.zh.ch (please mention a phone number, we call you back)
